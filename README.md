# Ansible Automation Platform Installation Lab

This version of the lab installs the Containerized version
of AAP 2.4.

You will need to place some file into the `payload` directory:

- a RHEL installation DVD ISO
- an AAP containerized installation bundle
- a license manifest file that has entitlements for AAP
- a tgz of the aap_postinstall directory, including your own additions
